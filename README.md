# Kaggle-Competition
This is a Kaggle Competition completed by Chen Dong from Boston University

# Datasets
Datasets are given in different purposes, and each of them are indicated by their names. The largest dataset contains about 1.7 millions of data.

# What we want to do?
The purpose is predict the missing values of a given dataset.

# How to start?
You should clone the repo and install python 3. Then, use the set-up file to check that you are ready to go. 

You can modify the codes that I provide. I use the gradient boosting decision tree to decrease the loss by 70 percent which is less than 1 now.

You can also use the confusion matrix to adjust your model accordingly.

# Reminder
The dataset is really, really large, and it takes me 10 hours to finish one feature extraction step. So, be patient and efficient.
